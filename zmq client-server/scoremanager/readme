This package i.e. scoremanager is designed as agent between players and database.
This package will update the database based on message reieved from players.
It is also responsible to publish the updated score and to the players.

Clientside is responsible to read database and publish the data to players

Serverside is responsible to store subscribed information to database

Note. I am also thinking about storing the data from players in log analysers for post processing and analysis.
Using splunk like log analyzers and query builders
